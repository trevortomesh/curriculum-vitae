### General Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of computing and other fields. I am particularly focused on interactive computing systems, cybernetic approaches to human-computer interaction, and "humane" computing system design, such as human-readable databases. Additionally, I have a keen interest in systems theory, games, and simulations. I am dedicated to involving students in research endeavors.

### Graduate Research in Educational Game Development (2011-2012)

*University of Worcester, Computing Department, Worcester, England*

- Developed a working prototype of an educational game for high school physics students using the Blender Game Engine.
- Conducted interviews with students to assess their knowledge and experiences with educational games and their interest in game-based learning.
- Presented research at various conferences in Europe and the UK.

### Interim Research Assistant (2010)

*University of Worcester, Computing Department, Worcester, England*

- Designed and developed simulations in the fields of waves and oscillations using video game technology for physics education.
- Utilized the Unreal Tournament 2004 engine to model oscillators for K-12 and undergraduate physics classrooms.
- Evaluated model fidelity by comparing to theoretical and computational models.

### Researcher, Research Experience for Undergraduates Program (2009)

*Vanderbilt University, Physics Department, Nashville, Tennessee*

- Computationally modeled the effects of black hole kicks on the density of globular clusters using N-body simulations on the ACCRE supercomputing cluster.
- Developed a density profiling program in FORTRAN for analyzing the density of globular clusters.
- Produced movies of the physical and density evolution of globular clusters using Supermongo.
- Enhanced N-body simulations with routines for random gravitational wave recoils in merging black hole pairs.

### Research Assistant, UW River Falls Radio Telescope (2009)

*UW River Falls Physics Department, River Falls, Wisconsin*

- Constructed a functional Radio JOVE radio telescope for receiving radio signals from Jupiter's magnetosphere.
- Processed, analyzed, and visualized the received data.

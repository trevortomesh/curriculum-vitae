### General Research Interests

My research interests are generally at the intersection of computing and other fields. I am especially interested in interactive computing systems and cybernetic approaches to human-computer interaction as well as "humane" approaches to computing system design (e.g. human readable databases). Other research interests include systems theory, games and simulations. I am especially passionate about student involvement in research.


### Graduate Research in Educational Game Development - 2011-2012 

University of Worcester, Computing Department, Worcester, England

-   Developed a working prototype of an educational game targeted at
    high school physics students in the Blender Game Engine.

-   Met with instructors to gather design specifications.

-   Carried out student interviews to asses knowledge and experiences
    with educational games and interest in games for learning.

-   Presented research at various conferences in Europe and the UK.


### Interim Research Assistant - 2010

University of Worcester, Computing Department, Worcester, England

-   Designed and developed simulations in the fields of waves and
    oscillations using video game technology for physics education

-   Used the Unreal Tournament 2004 engine to model oscillators realized
    and developed effective models for the K-12 and undergraduate
    physics classrooms.

-   Evaluated the fidelity of these models by comparing to theoretical
    and computational models.


### Researcher, Research Experience for Undergraduates Program - 2009 

Vanderbilt University, Physics Department, Nashville, Tennessee

-   Computationally modeled the effects of black hole kicks on the
    density of globular clusters by running an Nbody simulation on the
    ACCRE supercomputing cluster.

-   Was responsible for writing a density profiling program in FORTRAN
    to analyzed the density of a globular cluster on a logarithmic
    scale.

-   Wrote scripts in supermongo to produce movies of the physical
    evolution and the density evolution of these globular clusters.

-   Appended to N-body simulation a routine to provide random
    gravitational wave recoils to pairs of merging black holes.


### Researcher, UW River Falls Radio Telescope - 2009 

UW River Falls Physics Department, River Falls, Wisconsin

-   Constructed a functional Radio JOVE radio telescope to \"listen\" to
    radio signals from Jupiter's magnetosphere.

-   Processed, analyzed and visualized data.


### Research Assistant, IceCube Neutrino Detector - 2007 

UW-River Falls Physics Department, River Falls, Wisconsin

-   Built temperature stabilizing sunshades for digital optical modules,
    to be used at South Pole

-   Constructed customized crates for materials to be shipped to
    Antarctica

-   Learned and used AutoCAD to digitally document cargo crate design.


## Service

### Committees
#### Chair - University of Regina  Coop Committee (2022)
The coop committee is responsible for parsing and approving or denying
applications from potential coop positions. We are also responsible for reviewing
coop reports. 

#### Student Representative - University of Regina Creative Technologies Committee (2017-2018)

I attended joint meetings of the Arts and Computer Science departments to discuss the direction of and make decisions
about the Creative Technologies program.

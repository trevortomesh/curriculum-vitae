Researcher, Research Experience for Undergraduates Program - 2009 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Vanderbilt University, Physics Department, Nashville, Tennessee

-   Computationally modeled the effects of black hole kicks on the
    density of globular clusters by running an Nbody simulation on the
    ACCRE supercomputing cluster.

-   Was responsible for writing a density profiling program in FORTRAN
    to analyzed the density of a globular cluster on a logarithmic
    scale.

-   Wrote scripts in supermongo to produce movies of the physical
    evolution and the density evolution of these globular clusters.

-   Appended to N-body simulation a routine to provide random
    gravitational wave recoils to pairs of merging black holes.

Interim Research Assistant - 2010
---------------------------------

University of Worcester, Computing Department, Worcester, England

-   Designed and developed simulations in the fields of waves and
    oscillations using video game technology for physics education

-   Used the Unreal Tournament 2004 engine to model oscillators realized
    and developed effective models for the K-12 and undergraduate
    physics classrooms.

-   Evaluated the fidelity of these models by comparing to theoretical
    and computational models.
